# Algorithmic Trading via IG Market using the framework developed by g-program-it

This document provides a description of a trading strategy implemented through an automated system that identifies potential entry and exit opportunities in the market based on the selected strategy. The implementation includes the following functions:

1. Periodic scanning of market data.
2. Manipulation of price data into technical indicators using the MyTT package.
3. Evaluation of data to identify triggers for entry/exit requirements.
4. Alert notifications through a private Telegram bot for entering/exiting trades and the status of the algorithmic program.

It should be noted that this implementation is not a complete package, but rather a demonstration of its functionality. The remaining structures includes various credentials information and can be obtained from the original developer. Sincere appreciation to g-program-it for his valuable contribution.
